<h2><a name="annotations" id="annotations">Annotating Images</a></h2>
<p>
On the 'PL Results' panel, double click desired image to get 
the pop up dialog box to create annotations on the image.
</p> 
<h3>Creating Annotations</h3>
<p>
Annotations are represented by marking rectangular areas of the image 
for a specific feature. Each rectangle is color coded to represent a 
type of a feature. The following features are supported.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Face: Represented with <span style="background: yellow">yellow</span>.</li>
<li>Profile: Represented with <span style="background: red">red</span>.</li>
<li>Skin: Represented with <span style="background: cyan">cyan</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following tasks can be performed to create the annotations
</p>
<h4>Creating a new box</h4>
<p>
First select a desired feature by using the radio buttons at the top of 
the dialog box.

Using your mouse left button, hold it down to start at the upper left 
corner of the rectangle, drag the mouse to desired lower right corner 
of the rectangle, and release the button. (Do not worry about precise 
size and location of the box. You can always move and resize the box 
to desired area). 
Sometimes the size of the box is not locked. In that case, just click 
inside the box, to end the sizing. Then you should be able to move and 
resize the box to your desired place.
</p>
<h4>Select a box</h4>
<p>
Simply click on a box to highlight and bring it to the top of the 
canvas. Highlighting is indicated with thicker edges of the box.
</p>
<h4>Moving a box</h4>
<p>
First select a desired box and simply drag the box around using mouse 
left button.
</p>

<h4>Resizing a box</h4>
<p>
Select a desired box. There are three ways you can resize it.
</p> 
<ol>
<li>Drag the bottom right corner to the desired size. This moves bottom 
right corner around the canvas.</li>
<li>You can drag right edge to desired size.</li>
<li>You can drag bottom edge to the desired size.</li>
</ol> 
<h4>Deleting a box</h4>
<p>
Select the desired box. Hold down your Ctrl+Alt buttons on the keyboard 
and click on the box.
</p>
<h3>Saving annotations</h3>
<p>
Use 'Save Initial' or 'Save Final' buttons at the top to store all 
annotations on the canvas to the database for later retrieval. 
The annotations created on the canvas can be stored in database as 
initial annotations or final annotations. At this point, initial and 
final notion is used simply to support annotations by two persons. 
There are no software imposed rules on who should or should not act 
as initial or final.
</p>
<h3>Restoring Annotations from FaceFinder or/and Database</h3>
<p>
Clicking of restore buttons simply adds additional boxes
from those sources to the canvas. One way to use them, would be to create and save the 
boxes incrementally. For example create skin annotations, and save them. Clear the 
canvas and create faces. Now you can retrieve the saved skin boxes and store both skin and 
faces combined.
</p>
